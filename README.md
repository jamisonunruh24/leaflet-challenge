week 17 homework

Using data gather from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php in GEOjson formate, I created a interactive map that shows the locations of eathquakes that happened in the past 7 days.  The size of the marker is determinded by the magnitude of the earthquake and the color is determinded by the depth and color-coded by the legend in the bottom right.  Clicking on a circle will show the location of the earthquake and the time in Central Standard Time.
